# Calculator created by Filipp Klyuev

is compiled in Linux/Windows using g++ -std=c++17
Calculator supports '+' '-' '/' and '*' operations, and '.' ',' floating point symbols but can easily be 
reworked to support more types of operations. implicit '*' casting with 5(2 +3) and (5)(10) is supported, as well as -(1 +5) or +1 + 5 types of operations
To use, compile and launch - calculator will read and try to calculate input lines until explicitly stopped.
